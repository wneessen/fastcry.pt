# fastcry.pt - A quick and easy encrypted note system

## Easyily share a note - quick, secure, anonymous

### What is this all about? ####
The idea for fastcry.pt arose when I was in need for a quick and easy solution to share data with a 3rd party. The problem was, I only has an email address and the phone number (with WhatsApp contact) of the person I wanted to send the data. I ended up sending an encrypted ZIP file via mail and provide the password to him via WhatsApp. This worked but wasn't suffient to me. So I sat down a weekend and built this service. It is meant to be quick, easy to use, anonymous and secure - which I think I accomplished.

### How can I use it? ###
You can simply use the public interface at [fastcry.pt](fastcry.pt) or you can clone this project to host your own copy of fastcry.pt
